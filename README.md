# Recipies
Simple webpage for showing off some recipies I enjoy making. This is part of my journey through the Odin Project. 


## Goals
I hope to expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS and Ruby. Currently I have little experience in front and back end development. I can build very simple websites, however i hope to be able to design complex interactive websites by the end of this course.
